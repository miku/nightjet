> Evening conversations with and about AI. Aiming for 100 little programs and
> conversations about code, with various models.

Some goals are to

* write a few small programs *together with AI* that I wanted to write forever,
* systematically explore some of the boundaries of the current AI models regarding programming,
* prototype some real (web) applications and ship it,
* try to think of some *useless* programs that I still find interesting, and implement them.

## DONE

* [x] a program that generates a notebook gif, with a colorful band

## TODO

* [ ] a TUI for language learning, drill, not too fancy, with some gaming aspect
* [ ] a TUI for learning alphabets: hebrew, greek, cyrillic
* [ ] a TUI for learning the N most used chinese characters, or hangul, or kanji
* [ ] a simple desktop application that revolves around the "TAFELWERK" - learn about a topic, or solve some questions with a builtin equation editor
* [ ] a CLI for exploring a text corpus of a foreign language, ranking sentences by difficulty, automatic translation
* [ ] an simple "appointment scheduler for hackers", with webpage and CLI first approach
* [ ] a reprise on norvig UNIX help system article from 2001: https://research.google/pubs/intelligent-help-systems-for-unix/
* [ ] a TUI that allow to navigate a citation graph in some cool way
* [ ] a set of psychometric tests for the command line (similar to canny)
* [ ] an iOS app that would cache the audio of YT video for later listening (saving bandwidth, etc)
* [ ] a program that takes the curricula for elementary school, and compiles a workbook with related themes
* [ ] a program that looks like the S-Bahn station: L Bayerischer Bahnhof
* [ ] a theme: "this library does not exist", a mostly generated website, for the @kitt group
* [ ] a theme: "this book does not exists", description of book, excerpts and reviews, but no book
* [ ] a set of animation helpers to build gifs, or webms; "21st century gif", 21STWM, "21stwebm"
* [ ] a web site that helps you to analyze your github CI runs and failures quickly, like gh-workflow-stats
* [ ] a RAG for support chat over documents
* [ ] A RAG for catalog metadata
* [ ] A metadata completion tool (do a fine tune over metadata that is correct and then blank out known fields), maybe relate to the theme of metadata quality
* [ ] write a pure Go version of wapiti
