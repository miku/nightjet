EXP0000: Write a small command line application in Go that renders a
palm tree in the terminal.

Context:

This is a toy project, akin to cbonsai, a program to grow a bonsai on the
terminal. We do not want to grow a palm tree, but render trees with colors in
with some random aspect. When the program runs, it renders the tree and exists.
It does not need to take any parameters and use some random seed to generate
variations on each run.

Scope:

Write a command line tool in Go. It should be self contained and use ANSI color
codes, which are supported by most terminal emulators. Write the program, there
are not tests required. The palm should be a of a larger kind, an Arecaceae or
similar. A rendering, that one would associated with a palm tree.

Boundaries:

The program needs no command line flags. The palm tree should not exceed 20 or
30 characters in height. A single palm tree suffices. There should be some
variation in the rendering.

Only write out the code, no explanation required.

Specific Requirements:

Write idiomatic Go, use short variable names.
