# botec r/w ratio

How many lines of code can you read and understand per day? What does it mean
to understand a line?

If you could read 100 pages per day, that would be 3k SLOC per day, maybe ten
tokens per line, so 30K tokens per day. Google Gemini has an estimated 150
tokens/s. So in less than four minutes you may generate code to read and review
for a day.
