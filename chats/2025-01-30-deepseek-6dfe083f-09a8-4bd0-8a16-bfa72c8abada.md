To find a number that satisfies the given conditions, we can set up a system of congruences based on the problem statement:

1. \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \)
2. \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \)
3. \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)
4. \( x \equiv 4 \pmod{6} \)

### Step 1: Observe the pattern
Notice that in each case, the remainder is always 2 less than the divisor:
- \( 1 = 3 - 2 \)
- \( 2 = 4 - 2 \)
- \( 3 = 5 - 2 \)
- \( 4 = 6 - 2 \)

This suggests that \( x + 2 \) is divisible by 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, \( x + 2 \) is a common multiple of 3, 4, 5, and 6.

### Step 2: Find the least common multiple (LCM)
First, find the LCM of 3, 4, 5, and 6:
- Prime factorization:
  - \( 3 = 3 \)
  - \( 4 = 2^2 \)
  - \( 5 = 5 \)
  - \( 6 = 2 \cdot 3 \)
- The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes: \( 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 60 \).

Thus, \( x + 2 = 60k \), where \( k \) is a positive integer.

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[
x = 60k - 2
\]

### Step 4: Find the smallest positive solution
For \( k = 1 \):
\[
x = 60(1) - 2 = 58
\]

Verify that 58 satisfies all the original conditions:
1. \( 58 \div 3 = 19 \) with a remainder of 1.
2. \( 58 \div 4 = 14 \) with a remainder of 2.
3. \( 58 \div 5 = 11 \) with a remainder of 3.
4. \( 58 \div 6 = 9 \) with a remainder of 4.

All conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer:
The smallest such number is \( \boxed{58} \).
